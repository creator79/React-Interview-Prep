## Core React


1.  ### What is React?

    React(aka React.js or ReactJS) is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach.

    React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

    2. ### What is the history behind React evolution?
       The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.

    The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.

    But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.

    **Note:** JSX comes from the idea of XHP

2.  ### What are the major features of React?

    The major features of React are:

    - Uses **JSX** syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
    - It uses **Virtual DOM** instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.
    - Supports **server-side rendering** which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).
    - Follows **Unidirectional or one-way** data flow or data binding.
    - Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.

3.  ### What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript that allows us to write HTML-like code directly in our JavaScript code. This makes it easier to create and maintain complex React components.

**Example:**

````jsx harmony
export default function App() {
  return (
    <h1 className="greeting">{"Hello, this is a JSX Code!"}</h1>
  );
}

## Without JSx

import { createElement } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  return createElement(
    'h1',
    { className: 'greeting' },
    'Hello, this is a JSX Code!'
  );
}

## Class Component
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1 className="greeting">{"Hello, this is a JSX Code!"}</h1>
    );
  }
}

``` Note: JSX is stricter than HTML. ```

````

4.  ### What is the difference between Element and Component?

    An _Element_ is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. _Elements_ can contain other _Elements_ in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it cannot be mutated.

    The JavaScript representation(Without JSX) of React Element would be as follows:

    ```javascript
    const element = React.createElement("div", { id: "login-btn" }, "Login");
    ```

    and this element can be simiplified using JSX

    ```html
    <div id="login-btn">Login</div>
    ```

    The above `React.createElement()` function returns an object as below:

    ```
    {
      type: 'div',
      props: {
        children: 'Login',
        id: 'login-btn'
      }
    }
    ```

    Finally, this element renders to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`.

    Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:

    ```javascript
    const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => (
      <div id={"login-btn"} onClick={handleLogin}>
        Login
      </div>
    );
    ```

    Then JSX gets transpiled to a `React.createElement()` function tree:

    ```javascript
    const Button = ({ handleLogin }) =>
      React.createElement(
        "div",
        { id: "login-btn", onClick: handleLogin },
        "Login"
      );
    ```

5.  ### How to create components in React?

    Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component.

    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements to render the output:

       ```jsx harmony
       function Greeting({ message }) {
         return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;
       }
       ```

    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:

       ```jsx harmony
       class Greeting extends React.Component {
         render() {
           return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;
         }
       }
       ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

6.  ### When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?

    After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too.

    But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.

    1. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries.
    2. In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component.

    **Note:** You can also use reusable [react error boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.

    The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.

    ```jsx
    "use client";

    import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";

    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>
      <ExampleApplication />
    </ErrorBoundary>;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

7.  ### What are Pure Components?

    Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.

    But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.

    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,

    ```jsx
    const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);
    ```

    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).

    ```jsx
    import { memo, useState } from "react";

    const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>Name:{name}</p>
          <p>Email: {email}</p>
        </>
      );
    });
    export default function EmployeeRegForm() {
      const [name, setName] = useState("");
      const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
      return (
        <>
          <label>
            Name:{" "}
            <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
          </label>
          <label>
            Email:{" "}
            <input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
          </label>
          <hr />
          <EmployeeProfile name={name} />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.

    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.

    **Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

 8.  ### What is state in React?

    _State_ of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

    ![state](../images/state.jpg)

    Let's take an example of **User** component with message state. Here, **useState** hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.

    ```jsx harmony
    import React, { useState } from "react";

    function User() {
      const [message, setMessage] = useState("Welcome to React world");

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{message}</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

   <summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
    <p>

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    class User extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          message: "Welcome to React world",
        };
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    </p>


    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

9.  ### What are props in React?

    _Props_ are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.

    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

    1. Pass custom data to your component.
    2. Trigger state changes.
    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.

    For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:

    ```jsx harmony
    <Element reactProp={"1"} />
    ```

    This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

    ```jsx harmony
    props.reactProp;
    ```

    For example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:

    ```jsx
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

    const ChildComponent = (props) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>{props.name}</p>
          <p>{props.age}</p>
        </div>
      );
    };

    const ParentComponent = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <ChildComponent name="John" age="30" />
          <ChildComponent name="Mary" age="25" />
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```

The properties from props object can be accessed directly using destructing feature from ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). The above child component can be simplified like below.

```jsx harmony
const ChildComponent = ({ name, age }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <p>{age}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
     The Props accessed in Class Based Component as below

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class ChildComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.name}</p>
        <p>{this.props.age}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ChildComponent name="John" age="30" />
        <ChildComponent name="Mary" age="25" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

10. ### What is the difference between state and props?

    In React, both `state` and `props` are plain JavaScript objects and used to manage the data of a component, but they are used in different ways and have different characteristics.
    `state` is managed by the component itself and can be updated using the `setState()` function. Unlike props, state can be modified by the component and is used to manage the internal state of the component. Changes in the state trigger a re-render of the component and its children.
    `props` (short for "properties") are passed to a component by its parent component and are `read-only`, meaning that they cannot be modified by the component itself. props can be used to configure the behavior of a component and to pass data between components.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

11. ### Why should we not update the state directly?

    If you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.

    ```javascript
    //Wrong
    this.state.message = "Hello world";
    ```

    Instead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

    ```javascript
    //Correct
    this.setState({ message: "Hello World" });
    ```

    **Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in _constructor_ or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

12. ### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState()`?

    The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState()` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action.

    **Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.

    ```javascript
    setState({ name: "John" }, () =>
      console.log("The name has updated and component re-rendered")
    );
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13. ### What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?

    Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,

    1. In HTML, the event name usually represents in _lowercase_ as a convention:

       ```html
       <button onclick="activateLasers()"></button>
       ```

       Whereas in React it follows _camelCase_ convention:

       ```jsx harmony
       <button onClick={activateLasers}>
       ```

    2. In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:

       ```html
       <a
         href="#"
         onclick='console.log("The link was clicked."); return false;'
       />
       ```

       Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:

       ```javascript
       function handleClick(event) {
         event.preventDefault();
         console.log("The link was clicked.");
       }
       ```

    3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`
       Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name. (refer "activateLasers" function in the first point for example)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

14. ### How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?

    There are 3 possible ways to achieve this in class components:

    1. **Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same rule applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.

       ```javascript
       class User extends Component {
         constructor(props) {
           super(props);
           this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
         }
         handleClick() {
           console.log("SingOut triggered");
         }
         render() {
           return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>;
         }
       }
       ```

    2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don't like to use bind approach then _public class fields syntax_ can be used to correctly bind callbacks. The Create React App eanables this syntax by default.

       ```jsx harmony
       handleClick = () => {
         console.log("SingOut triggered", this);
       };
       ```

       ```jsx harmony
       <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>
       ```

    3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** It is possible to use _arrow functions_ directly in the callbacks.

       ```jsx harmony
       handleClick() {
           console.log('SingOut triggered');
       }
       render() {
           return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>SignOut</button>;
       }
       ```

    **Note:** If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with `.bind()` or _public class fields syntax_ approach considering performance.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

15. ### How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?

    You can use an _arrow function_ to wrap around an _event handler_ and pass parameters:

    ```jsx harmony
    <button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />
    ```

    This is an equivalent to calling `.bind`:

    ```jsx harmony
    <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />
    ```

    Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as arrow function

    ```jsx harmony
    <button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} />;
    handleClick = (id) => () => {
      console.log("Hello, your ticket number is", id);
    };
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

16. ### What are synthetic events in React?

    `SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using `nativeEvent` attribute.

    Let's take an example of BookStore title search component with the ability to get all native event properties

    ```js
    function BookStore() {
      handleTitleChange(e) {
        console.log('The new title is:', e.target.value);
        // 'e' represents synthetic event
        const nativeEvent = e.nativeEvent;
        console.log(nativeEvent);
        e.stopPropogation();
        e.preventDefault();
      }

      return <input name="title" onChange={handleTitleChange} />
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

17. ### What are inline conditional expressions?

    You can use either _if statements_ or _ternary expressions_ which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator `&&`.

    ```jsx harmony
    <h1>Hello!</h1>;
    {
      messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (
        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
      ) : (
        <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>
      );
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

18. ### What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?

    A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when mapping over arrays to render data. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

    Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:

    ```jsx harmony
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>);
    ```

    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:

    ```jsx harmony
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (
      <li key={index}>{todo.text}</li>
    ));
    ```

    **Note:**

    1. Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.
    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items.
    4. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

19. ### What is the use of refs?

    The _ref_ is used to return a reference to the element. They _should be avoided_ in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

20. ### How to create refs?

    There are two approaches

    1. This is a recently added approach. _Refs_ are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.

       ```jsx harmony
       class MyComponent extends React.Component {
         constructor(props) {
           super(props);
           this.myRef = React.createRef();
         }
         render() {
           return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
         }
       }
       ```

    2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows,
       ```jsx harmony
       class SearchBar extends Component {
         constructor(props) {
           super(props);
           this.txtSearch = null;
           this.state = { term: "" };
           this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => {
             this.txtSearch = e;
           };
         }
         onInputChange(event) {
           this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });
         }
         render() {
           return (
             <input
               value={this.state.term}
               onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}
               ref={this.setInputSearchRef}
             />
           );
         }
       }
       ```

    You can also use _refs_ in function components using **closures**.
    **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

21. ### What are forward refs?

    _Ref forwarding_ is a feature that lets some components take a _ref_ they receive, and pass it further down to a child.

    ```jsx harmony
    const ButtonElement = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
      <button ref={ref} className="CustomButton">
        {props.children}
      </button>
    ));

    // Create ref to the DOM button:
    const ref = React.createRef();
    <ButtonElement ref={ref}>{"Forward Ref"}</ButtonElement>;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

22. ### Which is preferred option with in callback refs and findDOMNode()?

    It is preferred to use _callback refs_ over `findDOMNode()` API. Because `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.

    The **legacy** approach of using `findDOMNode`:

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();
      }

      render() {
        return <div />;
      }
    }
    ```

    The recommended approach is:

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.node = createRef();
      }
      componentDidMount() {
        this.node.current.scrollIntoView();
      }

      render() {
        return <div ref={this.node} />;
      }
    }
    ```

23. ### Why are String Refs legacy?

    If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.

    1. They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.
    2. They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.
    3. They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.
    4. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the "render callback" pattern ```(e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)```

       ```jsx harmony
       class MyComponent extends Component {
         renderRow = (index) => {
           // This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:
           return <input ref={"input-" + index} />;

           // This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.
           return <input ref={(input) => (this["input-" + index] = input)} />;
         };

         render() {
           return (
             <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} />
           );
         }
       }
       ```

24. ### What is Virtual DOM?

    The _Virtual DOM_ (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of _Real DOM_. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called _reconciliation_.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

25. ### How Virtual DOM works?

    The _Virtual DOM_ works in three simple steps.

    1. Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.

       ![vdom](../images/vdom1.png)

    2. Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.

       ![vdom2](../images/vdom2.png)

    3. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed.

       ![vdom3](../images/vdom3.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

26. ### What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?

    The _Shadow DOM_ is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in _web components_. The _Virtual DOM_ is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

27. ### What is React Fiber?

    Fiber is the new _reconciliation_ engine or reimplementation of core algorithm in React v16. The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, gestures, ability to pause, abort, or reuse work and assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

28. ### What is the main goal of React Fiber?

    The goal of _React Fiber_ is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is **incremental rendering**: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

    _from documentation_

    Its main goals are:

    1. Ability to split interruptible work in chunks.
    2. Ability to prioritize, rebase and reuse work in progress.
    3. Ability to yield back and forth between parents and children to support layout in React.
    4. Ability to return multiple elements from render().
    5. Better support for error boundaries.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

29. ### What are controlled components?

    A component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called **Controlled Component**, i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.

    For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,

    ```javascript
    handleChange(event) {
      this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

30. ### What are uncontrolled components?

    The **Uncontrolled Components** are the ones that store their own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

    In the below UserProfile component, the `name` input is accessed using ref.

    ```jsx harmony
    class UserProfile extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
        this.input = React.createRef();
      }

      handleSubmit(event) {
        alert("A name was submitted: " + this.input.current.value);
        event.preventDefault();
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <label>
              {"Name:"}
              <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
            </label>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
          </form>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.

31. ### What is the difference between createElement and cloneElement?

    JSX elements will be transpiled to `React.createElement()` functions to create React elements which are going to be used for the object representation of UI. Whereas `cloneElement` is used to clone an element and pass it new props.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

32. ### What is Lifting State Up in React?

    When several components need to share the same changing data then it is recommended to _lift the shared state up_ to their closest common ancestor. That means if two child components share the same data from its parent, then move the state to parent instead of maintaining local state in both of the child components.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

33. ### What are the different phases of component lifecycle?

    The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:

    1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.

    2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.

    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.

    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows

    1. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.

    2. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.

    3. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.

    React 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))

    Before React 16.3

    ![phases 16.2](../images/phases.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

34. ### What are the lifecycle methods of React?

    Before React 16.3

    - **componentWillMount:** Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.
    - **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
    - **componentWillReceiveProps:** Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.
    - **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
    - **componentWillUpdate:** Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by `shouldComponentUpdate()` which returns true.
    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
    - **componentWillUnmount:** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

    React 16.3+

    - **getDerivedStateFromProps:** Invoked right before calling `render()` and is invoked on _every_ render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state. Worth reading [if you need derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html).
    - **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
    - **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after the state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives a new prop.
    - **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:** Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into `componentDidUpdate()`. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.
    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns `false`.
    - **componentWillUnmount** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

35. ### What are Higher-Order Components?

    A _higher-order component_ (_HOC_) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

    We call them **pure components** because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

    ```javascript
    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
    ```

    HOC can be used for many use cases:

    1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.
    2. Render hijacking.
    3. State abstraction and manipulation.
    4. Props manipulation.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

36. ### How to create props proxy for HOC component?

    You can add/edit props passed to the component using _props proxy_ pattern like this:

    ```jsx harmony
    function HOC(WrappedComponent) {
      return class Test extends Component {
        render() {
          const newProps = {
            title: "New Header",
            footer: false,
            showFeatureX: false,
            showFeatureY: true,
          };

          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} />;
        }
      };
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

37. ### What is context?

    _Context_ provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

    For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.

    ```javascript
    const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38. ### What is children prop?

    _Children_ is a prop (`this.props.children`) that allows you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as `children` prop.

    There are several methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only`, `React.Children.toArray`.

    A simple usage of children prop looks as below,

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyDiv = React.createClass({
      render: function () {
        return <div>{this.props.children}</div>;
      },
    });

    ReactDOM.render(
      <MyDiv>
        <span>{"Hello"}</span>
        <span>{"World"}</span>
      </MyDiv>,
      node
    );
    ```

39. ### How to write comments in React?

    The comments in React/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.

    **Single-line comments:**

    ```jsx harmony
    <div>
      {/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(//)) */}
      {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
    </div>
    ```

    **Multi-line comments:**

    ```jsx harmony
    <div>
      {/* Multi-line comments for more than
       one line */}
      {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
    </div>
    ```

40. ### What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?

    A child class constructor cannot make use of `this` reference until the `super()` method has been called. The same applies to ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason for passing props parameter to `super()` call is to access `this.props` in your child constructors.

    **Passing props:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        console.log(this.props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Not passing props:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super();

        console.log(this.props); // prints undefined

        // but props parameter is still available
        console.log(props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }

      render() {
        // no difference outside constructor
        console.log(this.props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }
    }
    ```

    The above code snippets reveals that `this.props` is different only within the constructor. It would be the same outside the constructor.

41. ### What is reconciliation?

    `Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the `real DOM` and the copy of DOM `(Virtual DOM)` when there's an update of components.
    React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
    Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called _Reconciliation_.

42. ### How to set state with a dynamic key name?

    If you are using ES6 or the Babel transpiler to transform your JSX code then you can accomplish this with _computed property names_.

    ```javascript
    handleInputChange(event) {
      this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

43. ### What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?

    You need to make sure that function is not being called while passing the function as a parameter.

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      // Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference!
      return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{'Click Me'}</button>
    }
    ```

    Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      // Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference!
      return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{'Click Me'}</button>
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

44. ### Is lazy function supports named exports?

    No, currently `React.lazy` function supports default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don’t pull unused components.
    Let's take a component file which exports multiple named components,

    ```javascript
    // MoreComponents.js
    export const SomeComponent = /* ... */;
    export const UnusedComponent = /* ... */;
    ```

    and reexport `MoreComponents.js` components in an intermediate file `IntermediateComponent.js`

    ```javascript
    // IntermediateComponent.js
    export { SomeComponent as default } from "./MoreComponents.js";
    ```

    Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,

    ```javascript
    import React, { lazy } from "react";
    const SomeComponent = lazy(() => import("./IntermediateComponent.js"));
    ```

45. ### Why React uses `className` over `class` attribute?

    The attribute `class` is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. That's the principal reason why React uses `className` instead of `class`. Pass a string as the `className` prop.

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return <span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}</span>
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

46. ### What are fragments?

It's a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. `_Fragments_ `let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

` You need to use either **<Fragment>** or a shorter syntax having empty tag (**<></>**).`

Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.

```jsx harmony
    function Story({title, description, date}) {
      return (
          <Fragment>
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            <p>{description}</p>
            <p>{date}</p>
          </Fragment>
        );
    }



It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.

`jsx harmony
    function StoryBook() {
      return stories.map(story =>
        <Fragment key={ story.id}>
          <h2>{story.title}</h2>
          <p>{story.description}</p>
          <p>{story.date}</p>
        </Fragment>
      );
    }
   `

`Ususally you don't need to use **<Fragment>** until unless there is a need of _key_ attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.`

``` jsx harmony
    function Story({title, description, date}) {
      return (
          <>
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            <p>{description}</p>
            <p>{date}</p>
          </>
      );
    }

````
 
  ```

47. ### Why fragments are better than container divs?

    Below are the list of reasons to prefer fragments over container DOM elements,

    1. Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
    2. Some CSS mechanisms like _Flexbox_ and _CSS Grid_ have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
    3. The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

48. ### What are portals in React?

    _Portal_ is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

    ```javascript
    ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
    ```

    The first argument is any render-able React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument is a DOM element.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

49. ### What are stateless components?

    If the behaviour of a component is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the `this` keyword altogether.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

50. ### What are stateful components?

    If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the _state_ of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These _stateful components_ are either function components with hooks or _class components_.

    Let's take an example of function stateful component which update the state based on click event,
    ```javascript
    import React, {useState} from 'react';

    const App = (props) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    handleIncrement() {
      setCount(count+1);
    }

    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
        <span>Counter: {count}</span>
      </>
      )
    }
    ```
    <summary><b>See Class</b> </summary>
  
    The equivalent class stateful component with a state that gets initialized in the `constructor`.

    ```jsx harmony
    class App extends Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
      }

      handleIncrement() {
        setState({count: this.state.count + 1})
      }

      render() {
        <>
         <button onClick={() => this.handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
         <span>Count: {count}</span>
        </>
      }
    }
  
    ```

51. ### How to apply validation on props in React?

    When the application is running in _development mode_, React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have _correct type_. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It's disabled in _production mode_ due to performance impact. The mandatory props are defined with `isRequired`.

    The set of predefined prop types:

    1. `PropTypes.number`
    2. `PropTypes.string`
    3. `PropTypes.array`
    4. `PropTypes.object`
    5. `PropTypes.func`
    6. `PropTypes.node`
    7. `PropTypes.element`
    8. `PropTypes.bool`
    9. `PropTypes.symbol`
    10. `PropTypes.any`

    We can define `propTypes` for `User` component as below:

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    import PropTypes from "prop-types";

    class User extends React.Component {
      static propTypes = {
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
        age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <>
            <h1>{`Welcome, ${this.props.name}`}</h1>
            <h2>{`Age, ${this.props.age}`}</h2>
          </>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    **Note:** In React v15.5 _PropTypes_ were moved from `React.PropTypes` to `prop-types` library.

    _The Equivalent Functional Component_

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    import PropTypes from "prop-types";

    function User({ name, age }) {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>{`Welcome, ${name}`}</h1>
          <h2>{`Age, ${age}`}</h2>
        </>
      );
    }

    User.propTypes = {
      name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    };
    ```

52. ### What are the advantages of React?

    Below are the list of main advantages of React,

    1. Increases the application's performance with _Virtual DOM_.
    2. JSX makes code easy to read and write.
    3. It renders both on client and server side (_SSR_).
    4. Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.
    5. Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.

53. ### What are the limitations of React?

    Apart from the advantages, there are few limitations of React too,

    1. React is just a view library, not a full framework.
    2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.
    3. Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration.
    4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.
    5. Too many smaller components leading to over engineering or boilerplate.

54. ### What are error boundaries in React v16?

    _Error boundaries_ are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

    A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called `componentDidCatch(error, info)` or `static getDerivedStateFromError() `:

    ```jsx harmony
    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
      }

      componentDidCatch(error, info) {
        // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
        logErrorToMyService(error, info);
      }

      static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
        return { hasError: true };
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          // You can render any custom fallback UI
          return <h1>{"Something went wrong."}</h1>;
        }
        return this.props.children;
      }
    }
    ```

    After that use it as a regular component:

    ```jsx harmony
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyWidget />
    </ErrorBoundary>
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55. ### How are error boundaries handled in React v15?

    React v15 provided very basic support for _error boundaries_ using `unstable_handleError` method. It has been renamed to `componentDidCatch` in React v16.

56. ### What are the recommended ways for static type checking?

    Normally we use _PropTypes library_ (`React.PropTypes` moved to a `prop-types` package since React v15.5) for _type checking_ in the React applications. For large code bases, it is recommended to use _static type checkers_ such as Flow or TypeScript, that perform type checking at compile time and provide auto-completion features.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

57. ### What is the use of `react-dom` package?

    The `react-dom` package provides _DOM-specific methods_ that can be used at the top level of your app. Most of the components are not required to use this module. Some of the methods of this package are:

    1. `render()`
    2. `hydrate()`
    3. `unmountComponentAtNode()`
    4. `findDOMNode()`
    5. `createPortal()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

58. ### What is the purpose of render method of `react-dom`?

    This method is used to render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container and return a reference to the component. If the React element was previously rendered into container, it will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest changes.

    ```
    ReactDOM.render(element, container, [callback])
    ```

    If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or updated.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

59. ### What is ReactDOMServer?

    The `ReactDOMServer` object enables you to render components to static markup (typically used on node server). This object is mainly used for _server-side rendering_ (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:

    1. `renderToString()`
    2. `renderToStaticMarkup()`

    For example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call `renderToString` to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.

    ```javascript
    // using Express
    import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
    import MyPage from "./MyPage";

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.write(
        "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>My Page</title></head><body>"
      );
      res.write('<div id="content">');
      res.write(renderToString(<MyPage />));
      res.write("</div></body></html>");
      res.end();
    });
    ```

60. ### How to use innerHTML in React?

    The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute is React's replacement for using `innerHTML` in the browser DOM. Just like `innerHTML`, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a `__html` object as key and HTML text as value.

    In this example MyComponent uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute for setting HTML markup:

    ```jsx harmony
    function createMarkup() {
      return { __html: "First &middot; Second" };
    }

    function MyComponent() {
      return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />;
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

61. ### How to use styles in React?

    The `style` attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.

    ```jsx harmony
    const divStyle = {
      color: "blue",
      backgroundImage: "url(" + imgUrl + ")",
    };

    function HelloWorldComponent() {
      return <div style={divStyle}>Hello World!</div>;
    }
    ```

    Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes in JavaScript (e.g. `node.style.backgroundImage`).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

62. ### How events are different in React?

    Handling events in React elements has some syntactic differences:

    1. React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
    2. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

63. ### What will happen if you use `setState()` in constructor?

    When you use `setState()`, then apart from assigning to the object state React also re-renders the component and all its children. You would get error like this: _Can only update a mounted or mounting component._ So we need to use `this.state` to initialize variables inside constructor.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

64. ### What is the impact of indexes as keys?

    Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep track of elements.

    In the below code snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented. This limits the optimizations that React can do.

    ```jsx harmony
    {
      todos.map((todo, index) => <Todo {...todo} key={index} />);
    }
    ```

    If you use element data for unique key, assuming todo.id is unique to this list and stable, React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.

    ```jsx harmony
    {
      todos.map((todo) => <Todo {...todo} key={todo.id} />);
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

65. ### Is it good to use `setState()` in `componentWillMount()` method?

    Yes, it is safe to use `setState()` inside `componentWillMount()` method. But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in `componentWillMount()` lifecycle method. `componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before `render()`, therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in `componentDidMount()` instead of `componentWillMount()`.

    ```jsx harmony
    componentDidMount() {
      axios.get(`api/todos`)
        .then((result) => {
          this.setState({
            messages: [...result.data]
          })
        })
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

66. ### What will happen if you use props in initial state?

    If the props on the component are changed without the component being refreshed, the new prop value will never be displayed because the constructor function will never update the current state of the component. The initialization of state from props only runs when the component is first created.

    The below component won't display the updated input value:

    ```jsx harmony
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          records: [],
          inputValue: this.props.inputValue,
        };
      }

      render() {
        return <div>{this.state.inputValue}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```

    Using props inside render method will update the value:

    ```jsx harmony
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          record: [],
        };
      }

      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.inputValue}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67. ### How do you conditionally render components?

    In some cases you want to render different components depending on some state. JSX does not render `false` or `undefined`, so you can use conditional _short-circuiting_ to render a given part of your component only if a certain condition is true.

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
      <div>
        <h2>{name}</h2>
        {address && <p>{address}</p>}
      </div>
    );
    ```

    If you need an `if-else` condition then use _ternary operator_.

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
      <div>
        <h2>{name}</h2>
        {address ? <p>{address}</p> : <p>{"Address is not available"}</p>}
      </div>
    );
    ```

68. ### Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?

    When we _spread props_ we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice. Instead we can use prop destructuring with `...rest` operator, so it will add only required props.

    For example,

    ```jsx harmony
    const ComponentA = () => (
      <ComponentB isDisplay={true} className={"componentStyle"} />
    );

    const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) => (
      <div {...domProps}>{"ComponentB"}</div>
    );
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

69. ### How you use decorators in React?

    You can _decorate_ your _class_ components, which is the same as passing the component into a function. **Decorators** are flexible and readable way of modifying component functionality.

    ```jsx harmony
    @setTitle("Profile")
    class Profile extends React.Component {
      //....
    }

    /*
      title is a string that will be set as a document title
      WrappedComponent is what our decorator will receive when
      put directly above a component class as seen in the example above
    */

    const setTitle = (title) => (WrappedComponent) => {
      return class extends React.Component {
        componentDidMount() {
          document.title = title;
        }

        render() {
          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        }
      };
    };
    ```

    **Note:** Decorators are a feature that didn't make it into ES7, but are currently a _stage 2 proposal_.

70. ### How do you memoize a component?

    There are memoize libraries available which can be used on function components.

    For example `moize` library can memoize the component in another component.

    ```jsx harmony
    import moize from "moize";
    import Component from "./components/Component"; // this module exports a non-memoized component

    const MemoizedFoo = moize.react(Component);

    const Consumer = () => {
      <div>
        {"I will memoize the following entry:"}
        <MemoizedFoo />
      </div>;
    };
    ```

    **Update:** Since React v16.6.0, we have a `React.memo`. It provides a higher order component which memoizes component unless the props change. To use it, simply wrap the component using React.memo before you use it.

    ```js
    const MemoComponent = React.memo(function MemoComponent(props) {
      /* render using props */
    });
    OR;
    export default React.memo(MyFunctionComponent);
    ```

71. ### How you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?

    React is already equipped to handle rendering on Node servers. A special version of the DOM renderer is available, which follows the same pattern as on the client side.

    ```jsx harmony
    import ReactDOMServer from "react-dom/server";
    import App from "./App";

    ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);
    ```

    This method will output the regular HTML as a string, which can be then placed inside a page body as part of the server response. On the client side, React detects the pre-rendered content and seamlessly picks up where it left off.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

72. ### How to enable production mode in React?

    You should use Webpack's `DefinePlugin` method to set `NODE_ENV` to `production`, by which it strip out things like propType validation and extra warnings. Apart from this, if you minify the code, for example, Uglify's dead-code elimination to strip out development only code and comments, it will drastically reduce the size of your bundle.

73. ### What is CRA and its benefits?

    The `create-react-app` CLI tool allows you to quickly create & run React applications with no configuration step.

    Let's create Todo App using _CRA_:

    ```console
    # Installation
    $ npm install -g create-react-app

    # Create new project
    $ create-react-app todo-app
    $ cd todo-app

    # Build, test and run
    $ npm run build
    $ npm run test
    $ npm start
    ```

    It includes everything we need to build a React app:

    1. React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
    2. Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
    3. Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
    4. A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
    5. A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
    6. A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and ../images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.

74. ### What is the lifecycle methods order in mounting?

    The lifecycle methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

    1. `constructor()`
    2. `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`
    3. `render()`
    4. `componentDidMount()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

75. ### What are the lifecycle methods going to be deprecated in React v16?

    The following lifecycle methods going to be unsafe coding practices and will be more problematic with async rendering.

    1. `componentWillMount()`
    2. `componentWillReceiveProps()`
    3. `componentWillUpdate()`

    Starting with React v16.3 these methods are aliased with `UNSAFE_` prefix, and the unprefixed version will be removed in React v17.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

76. ### What is the purpose of `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method?

    The new static `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method is invoked after a component is instantiated as well as before it is re-rendered. It can return an object to update state, or `null` to indicate that the new props do not require any state updates.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    This lifecycle method along with `componentDidUpdate()` covers all the use cases of `componentWillReceiveProps()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

77. ### What is the purpose of `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method?

    The new `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method is called right before DOM updates. The return value from this method will be passed as the third parameter to `componentDidUpdate()`.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    This lifecycle method along with `componentDidUpdate()` covers all the use cases of `componentWillUpdate()`.

78. ### Do Hooks replace render props and higher order components?

    Both render props and higher-order components render only a single child but in most of the cases Hooks are a simpler way to serve this by reducing nesting in your tree.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

79. ### What is the recommended way for naming components?

    It is recommended to name the component by reference instead of using `displayName`.

    Using `displayName` for naming component:

    ```javascript
    export default React.createClass({
      displayName: "TodoApp",
      // ...
    });
    ```

    The **recommended** approach:

    ```javascript
    export default class TodoApp extends React.Component {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    also

    ```javascript
    const TodoApp = () => {
      //...
    };
    export default TodoApp;
    ```

80. ### What is the recommended ordering of methods in component class?

    _Recommended_ ordering of methods from _mounting_ to _render stage_:

    1. `static` methods
    2. `constructor()`
    3. `getChildContext()`
    4. `componentWillMount()`
    5. `componentDidMount()`
    6. `componentWillReceiveProps()`
    7. `shouldComponentUpdate()`
    8. `componentWillUpdate()`
    9. `componentDidUpdate()`
    10. `componentWillUnmount()`
    11. click handlers or event handlers like `onClickSubmit()` or `onChangeDescription()`
    12. getter methods for render like `getSelectReason()` or `getFooterContent()`
    13. optional render methods like `renderNavigation()` or `renderProfilePicture()`
    14. `render()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

81. ### What is a switching component?

    A _switching component_ is a component that renders one of many components. We need to use object to map prop values to components.

    For example, a switching component to display different pages based on `page` prop:

    ```jsx harmony
    import HomePage from "./HomePage";
    import AboutPage from "./AboutPage";
    import ServicesPage from "./ServicesPage";
    import ContactPage from "./ContactPage";

    const PAGES = {
      home: HomePage,
      about: AboutPage,
      services: ServicesPage,
      contact: ContactPage,
    };

    const Page = (props) => {
      const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage;

      return <Handler {...props} />;
    };

    // The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.
    Page.propTypes = {
      page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired,
    };
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

82. ### Why we need to pass a function to setState()?

    The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.

    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.

    ```javascript
    // assuming this.state.count === 0
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    // this.state.count === 1, not 3
    ```

    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.

    ```javascript
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      count: prevState.count + props.increment,
    }));
    // this.state.count === 3 as expected
    ```

    **(OR)**

    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?

    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

    This counter example will fail to update as expected:

    ```javascript
    // Wrong
    this.setState({
      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
    });
    ```

    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

    ```javascript
    // Correct
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,
    }));
    ```

84. ### What are React Mixins?

    _Mixins_ are a way to totally separate components to have a common functionality. Mixins **should not be used** and can be replaced with _higher-order components_ or _decorators_.

    One of the most commonly used mixins is `PureRenderMixin`. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:

    ```javascript
    const PureRenderMixin = require("react-addons-pure-render-mixin");

    const Button = React.createClass({
      mixins: [PureRenderMixin],
      // ...
    });
    ```

     ## TODO: mixins are deprecated

85. ### Why is `isMounted()` an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?

    The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.

    ```javascript
    if (this.isMounted()) {
      this.setState({...})
    }
    ```

    Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.

    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting.

86. ### What are the Pointer Events supported in React?

    _Pointer Events_ provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the _Pointer Events_ specification.

    The following event types are now available in _React DOM_:

    1. `onPointerDown`
    2. `onPointerMove`
    3. `onPointerUp`
    4. `onPointerCancel`
    5. `onGotPointerCapture`
    6. `onLostPointerCapture`
    7. `onPointerEnter`
    8. `onPointerLeave`
    9. `onPointerOver`
    10. `onPointerOut`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87. ### Why should component names start with capital letter?

    If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as an unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.

    ```jsx harmony
    class SomeComponent extends Component {
      // Code goes here
    }
    ```

    You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

    ```jsx harmony
    class myComponent extends Component {
      render() {
        return <div />;
      }
    }

    export default myComponent;
    ```

    While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:

    ```jsx harmony
    import MyComponent from "./myComponent";

    #### What are the exceptions on React component naming?

    The component names should start with an uppercase letter but there are few exceptions to this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names.
    For example, the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,

    ```jsx harmony
         render() {
              return (
                <obj.component/> // `React.createElement(obj.component)`
              )
        }
    ```

88. ### Are custom DOM attributes supported in React v16?

    Yes. In the past, React used to ignore unknown DOM attributes. If you wrote JSX with an attribute that React doesn't recognize, React would just skip it.

    For example, let's take a look at the below attribute:

    ```jsx harmony
    <div mycustomattribute={"something"} />
    ```

    Would render an empty div to the DOM with React v15:

    ```html
    <div />
    ```

    In React v16 any unknown attributes will end up in the DOM:

    ```html
    <div mycustomattribute="something" />
    ```

    This is useful for supplying browser-specific non-standard attributes, trying new DOM APIs, and integrating with opinionated third-party libraries.

89. ### What is the difference between constructor and getInitialState?

    You should initialize state in the constructor when using ES6 classes, and `getInitialState()` method when using `React.createClass()`.

    **Using ES6 classes:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          /* initial state */
        };
      }
    }
    ```

    **Using `React.createClass()`:**

    ```javascript
    const MyComponent = React.createClass({
      getInitialState() {
        return {
          /* initial state */
        };
      },
    });
    ```

    **Note:** `React.createClass()` is deprecated and removed in React v16. Use plain JavaScript classes instead.

90. ### Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?

    By default, when your component's state or props change, your component will re-render. If your `render()` method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling `forceUpdate()`.

    ```javascript
    component.forceUpdate(callback);
    ```

    It is recommended to avoid all uses of `forceUpdate()` and only read from `this.props` and `this.state` in `render()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

91. ### What is the difference between `super()` and `super(props)` in React using ES6 classes?

    When you want to access `this.props` in `constructor()` then you should pass props to `super()` method.

    **Using `super(props)`:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        console.log(this.props); // { name: 'John', ... }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Using `super()`:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super();
        console.log(this.props); // undefined
      }
    }
    ```

    Outside `constructor()` both will display same value for `this.props`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

92. ### How to loop inside JSX?

    You can simply use `Array.prototype.map` with ES6 _arrow function_ syntax.

    For example, the `items` array of objects is mapped into an array of components:

    ```jsx harmony
    <tbody>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} />
      ))}
    </tbody>
    ```

    But you can't iterate using `for` loop:

    ```jsx harmony
    <tbody>
      for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        <SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} />
      }
    </tbody>
    ```

    This is because JSX tags are transpiled into _function calls_, and you can't use statements inside expressions. This may change thanks to `do` expressions which are _stage 1 proposal_.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

93. ### How do you access props in attribute quotes?

    React (or JSX) doesn't support variable interpolation inside an attribute value. The below representation won't work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src="../images/{this.props.image}" />
    ```

    But you can put any JS expression inside curly braces as the entire attribute value. So the below expression works:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src={"../images/" + this.props.image} />
    ```

    Using _template strings_ will also work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src={`../images/${this.props.image}`} />
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

94. ### What is React proptype array with shape?

    If you want to pass an array of objects to a component with a particular shape then use `React.PropTypes.shape()` as an argument to `React.PropTypes.arrayOf()`.

    ```javascript
    ReactComponent.propTypes = {
      arrayWithShape: React.PropTypes.arrayOf(
        React.PropTypes.shape({
          color: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
          fontSize: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
        })
      ).isRequired,
    };
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

95. ### How to conditionally apply class attributes?

    You shouldn't use curly braces inside quotes because it is going to be evaluated as a string.

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className="btn-panel {this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}">
    ```

    Instead you need to move curly braces outside (don't forget to include spaces between class names):

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className={'btn-panel ' + (this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden')}>
    ```

    _Template strings_ will also work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className={`btn-panel ${this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}`}>
    ```

96. ### What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

    The `react` package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The `react-dom` package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in `react-dom/server` we have _server-side rendering_ support with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

97. ### Why ReactDOM is separated from React?

    The React team worked on extracting all DOM-related features into a separate library called _ReactDOM_. React v0.14 is the first release in which the libraries are split. By looking at some of the packages, `react-native`, `react-art`, `react-canvas`, and `react-three`, it has become clear that the beauty and essence of React has nothing to do with browsers or the DOM.

    To build more environments that React can render to, React team planned to split the main React package into two: `react` and `react-dom`. This paves the way to writing components that can be shared between the web version of React and React Native.

98. ### How to use React label element?

    If you try to render a `<label>` element bound to a text input using the standard `for` attribute, then it produces HTML missing that attribute and prints a warning to the console.

    ```jsx harmony
    <label for={'user'}>{'User'}</label>
    <input type={'text'} id={'user'} />
    ```

    Since `for` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, use `htmlFor` instead.

    ```jsx harmony
    <label htmlFor={'user'}>{'User'}</label>
    <input type={'text'} id={'user'} />
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

99. ### How to combine multiple inline style objects?

    You can use _spread operator_ in regular React:

    ```jsx harmony
    <button style={{ ...styles.panel.button, ...styles.panel.submitButton }}>
      {"Submit"}
    </button>
    ```

    If you're using React Native then you can use the array notation:

    ```jsx harmony
    <button style={[styles.panel.button, styles.panel.submitButton]}>
      {"Submit"}
    </button>
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

100.  ### How to re-render the view when the browser is resized?

      You can use the `useState` hook to manage the width and height state variables, and the `useEffect` hook to add and remove the `resize` event listener. The `[]` dependency array passed to useEffect ensures that the effect only runs once (on mount) and not on every re-render.

      ```javascript
      import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
      function WindowDimensions() {
        const [dimensions, setDimensions] = useState({
          width: window.innerWidth,
          height: window.innerHeight,
        });

        useEffect(() => {
          function handleResize() {
            setDimensions({
              width: window.innerWidth,
              height: window.innerHeight,
            });
          }
          window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
          return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
        }, []);

        return (
          <span>
            {dimensions.width} x {dimensions.height}
          </span>
        );
      }
      ```
    
        ``` js

        <summary><h4>Using Class Component</h4></summary>
        You can listen to the `resize` event in `componentDidMount()` and then update the dimensions (`width` and `height`). You should remove the listener in `componentWillUnmount()` method.
       

            class WindowDimensions extends React.Component {
              constructor(props) {
                super(props);
                this.updateDimensions = this.updateDimensions.bind(this);
              }

              componentWillMount() {
                this.updateDimensions();
              }

              componentDidMount() {
                window.addEventListener("resize", this.updateDimensions);
              }

              componentWillUnmount() {
                window.removeEventListener("resize", this.updateDimensions);
              }

              updateDimensions() {
                this.setState({
                  width: window.innerWidth,
                  height: window.innerHeight,
                });
              }

              render() {
                return (
                  <span>
                    {this.state.width} x {this.state.height}
                  </span>
                );
              }
            }
          
            ```

101. ### What is the difference between `setState()` and `replaceState()` methods?

     When you use `setState()` the current and previous states are merged. `replaceState()` throws out the current state, and replaces it with only what you provide. Usually `setState()` is used unless you really need to remove all previous keys for some reason. You can also set state to `false`/`null` in `setState()` instead of using `replaceState()`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

102. ### How to listen to state changes?

     The `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method will be called when state changes. You can compare provided state and props values with current state and props to determine if something meaningful changed.

     ```
     componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)
     ```

     **Note:** The previous releases of ReactJS also uses `componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)` for state changes. It has been deprecated in latest releases.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

103. ### What is the recommended approach of removing an array element in React state?

     The better approach is to use `Array.prototype.filter()` method.

     For example, let's create a `removeItem()` method for updating the state.

     ```javascript
     removeItem(index) {
       this.setState({
         data: this.state.data.filter((item, i) => i !== index)
       })
     }
     ```

104. ### Is it possible to use React without rendering HTML?

     It is possible. Below are the possible options:

     ```jsx harmony
     render() {
       return false
     }
     ```

     ```jsx harmony
     render() {
       return true
     }
     ```

     ```jsx harmony
     render() {
       return null
     }
     ```

     React version >=16.0.0:

     ```jsx harmony
     render() {
       return []
     }
     ```

     ```jsx harmony
     render() {
       return ""
     }
     ```

     React version >=16.2.0:

     ```jsx harmony
     render() {
       return <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
     }
     ```

     ```jsx harmony
     render() {
       return <></>
     }
     ```

     React version >=18.0.0:

     ```jsx harmony
     render() {
       return undefined
     }
     ```

105. ### How to pretty print JSON with React?

     We can use `<pre>` tag so that the formatting of the `JSON.stringify()` is retained:

     ```jsx harmony
     const data = { name: "John", age: 42 };

     class User extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>;
       }
     }

     React.render(<User />, document.getElementById("container"));
     ```

106. ### Why you can't update props in React?

     The React philosophy is that props should be _immutable_ and _top-down_. This means that a parent can send any prop values to a child, but the child can't modify received props.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

107. ### How to focus an input element on page load?

     You can do it by creating _ref_ for `input` element and using it in `componentDidMount()`:

     ```jsx harmony
     class App extends React.Component {
       componentDidMount() {
         this.nameInput.focus();
       }

       render() {
         return (
           <div>
             <input defaultValue={"Won't focus"} />
             <input
               ref={(input) => (this.nameInput = input)}
               defaultValue={"Will focus"}
             />
           </div>
         );
       }
     }

     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
     ```

     Also in Functional component (react 16.08 and above)

     ```jsx harmony
     import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

     const App = () => {
       const inputElRef = useRef(null);

       useEffect(() => {
         inputElRef.current.focus();
       }, []);

       return (
         <div>
           <input defaultValue={"Won't focus"} />
           <input ref={inputElRef} defaultValue={"Will focus"} />
         </div>
       );
     };

     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
     ```

108. ### What are the possible ways of updating objects in state?

     1. **Calling `setState()` with an object to merge with state:**

        - Using `Object.assign()` to create a copy of the object:

          ```javascript
          const user = Object.assign({}, this.state.user, { age: 42 });
          this.setState({ user });
          ```

        - Using _spread operator_:

          ```javascript
          const user = { ...this.state.user, age: 42 };
          this.setState({ user });
          ```

     2. **Calling `setState()` with a function:**

        ```javascript
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          user: {
            ...prevState.user,
            age: 42,
          },
        }));
        ```

110. ### How can we find the version of React at runtime in the browser?

     You can use `React.version` to get the version.

     ```jsx harmony
     const REACT_VERSION = React.version;

     ReactDOM.render(
       <div>{`React version: ${REACT_VERSION}`}</div>,
       document.getElementById("app")
     );

111. ### What are the approaches to include polyfills in your `create-react-app`?

     There are approaches to include polyfills in create-react-app,

     1. **Manual import from `core-js`:**

        Create a file called (something like) `polyfills.js` and import it into root `index.js` file. Run `npm install core-js` or `yarn add core-js` and import your specific required features.

        ```javascript
        import "core-js/fn/array/find";
        import "core-js/fn/array/includes";
        import "core-js/fn/number/is-nan";
        ```

     2. **Using Polyfill service:**

        Use the polyfill.io CDN to retrieve custom, browser-specific polyfills by adding this line to `index.html`:

        ```html
        <script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=default,Array.prototype.includes"></script>
        ```

        In the above script we had to explicitly request the `Array.prototype.includes` feature as it is not included in the default feature set.

112. ### How to use https instead of http in create-react-app?

     You just need to use `HTTPS=true` configuration. You can edit your `package.json` scripts section:

     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "set HTTPS=true && react-scripts start"
     }
     ```

     or just run `set HTTPS=true && npm start`

113. ### How to avoid using relative path imports in create-react-app?

     Create a file called `.env` in the project root and write the import path:

     ```
     NODE_PATH=src/app
     ```

     After that restart the development server. Now you should be able to import anything inside `src/app` without relative paths.

     Add a listener on the `history` object to record each page view:

     ```javascript
     history.listen(function (location) {
       window.ga("set", "page", location.pathname + location.search);
       window.ga("send", "pageview", location.pathname + location.search);
     });

115. ### How to update a component every second?

     You need to use `setInterval()` to trigger the change, but you also need to clear the timer when the component unmounts to prevent errors and memory leaks.

     ```javascript
     componentDidMount() {
       this.interval = setInterval(() => this.setState({ time: Date.now() }), 1000)
     }

     componentWillUnmount() {
       clearInterval(this.interval)
     }
     ```

116. ### How do you apply vendor prefixes to inline styles in React?

     React _does not_ apply _vendor prefixes_ automatically. You need to add vendor prefixes manually.

     ```jsx harmony
     <div
       style={{
         transform: "rotate(90deg)",
         WebkitTransform: "rotate(90deg)", // note the capital 'W' here
         msTransform: "rotate(90deg)", // 'ms' is the only lowercase vendor prefix
       }}
     />
     ```

117. ### How to import and export components using React and ES6?

     You should use default for exporting the components

     ```jsx harmony
     import React from "react";
     import User from "user";

     export default class MyProfile extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <User type="customer">//...</User>;
       }
     }
     ```

     With the export specifier, the MyProfile is going to be the member and exported to this module and the same can be imported without mentioning the name in other components.

119. ### Why is a component constructor called only once?

     React's _reconciliation_ algorithm assumes that without any information to the contrary, if a custom component appears in the same place on subsequent renders, it's the same component as before, so reuses the previous instance rather than creating a new one.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

120. ### How to define constants in React?

     You can use ES7 `static` field to define constant.

     ```javascript
     class MyComponent extends React.Component {
       static DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 10;
     }
     ```

121. ### How to programmatically trigger click event in React?

     You could use the ref prop to acquire a reference to the underlying `HTMLInputElement` object through a callback, store the reference as a class property, then use that reference to later trigger a click from your event handlers using the `HTMLElement.click` method.

     This can be done in two steps:

     1. Create ref in render method:

        ```jsx harmony
        <input ref={(input) => (this.inputElement = input)} />
        ```

     2. Apply click event in your event handler:

        ```javascript
        this.inputElement.click();
        ```

122. ### Is it possible to use async/await in plain React?

     If you want to use `async`/`await` in React, you will need _Babel_ and [transform-async-to-generator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator) plugin. React Native ships with Babel and a set of transforms.

123. ### What are the common folder structures for React?

     There are two common practices for React project file structure.

     1. **Grouping by features or routes:**

        One common way to structure projects is locate CSS, JS, and tests together, grouped by feature or route.

     2. **Grouping by file type:**

        Another popular way to structure projects is to group similar files together.

        ```
        api/
        ├─ APIUtils.js
        ├─ APIUtils.test.js
        ├─ ProfileAPI.js
        └─ UserAPI.js
        components/
        ├─ Avatar.js
        ├─ Avatar.css
        ├─ Feed.js
        ├─ Feed.css
        ├─ FeedStory.js
        ├─ FeedStory.test.js
        ├─ Profile.js
        ├─ ProfileHeader.js
        └─ ProfileHeader.css
        ```

125. ### What is the benefit of styles modules?

     It is recommended to avoid hard coding style values in components. Any values that are likely to be used across different UI components should be extracted into their own modules.

     For example, these styles could be extracted into a separate component:

     ```javascript
     export const colors = {
       white,
       black,
       blue,
     };

     export const space = [0, 8, 16, 32, 64];
     ```

     And then imported individually in other components:

     ```javascript
     import { space, colors } from "./styles";
     ```

126. ### What are the popular React-specific linters?

     ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter. There are plugins available that analyse specific code styles. One of the most common for React is an npm package called `eslint-plugin-react`. By default, it will check a number of best practices, with rules checking things from keys in iterators to a complete set of prop types.

     Another popular plugin is `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, which will help fix common issues with accessibility. As JSX offers slightly different syntax to regular HTML, issues with `alt` text and `tabindex`, for example, will not be picked up by regular plugins.

127. ### How to make AJAX call and in which component lifecycle methods should I make an AJAX call?

     You can use AJAX libraries such as Axios, jQuery AJAX, and the browser built-in `fetch`. You should fetch data in the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method. This is so you can use `setState()` to update your component when the data is retrieved.

     For example, the employees list fetched from API and set local state:

     ```jsx harmony
     class MyComponent extends React.Component {
       constructor(props) {
         super(props);
         this.state = {
           employees: [],
           error: null,
         };
       }

       componentDidMount() {
         fetch("https://api.example.com/items")
           .then((res) => res.json())
           .then(
             (result) => {
               this.setState({
                 employees: result.employees,
               });
             },
             (error) => {
               this.setState({ error });
             }
           );
       }

       render() {
         const { error, employees } = this.state;
         if (error) {
           return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
         } else {
           return (
             <ul>
               {employees.map((employee) => (
                 <li key={employee.name}>
                   {employee.name}-{employee.experience}
                 </li>
               ))}
             </ul>
           );
         }
       }
     }
     ```

128. ### What are render props?

     **Render Props** is a simple technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. The below component uses render prop which returns a React element.

     ```jsx harmony
     <DataProvider render={(data) => <h1>{`Hello ${data.target}`}</h1>} />
     ```
